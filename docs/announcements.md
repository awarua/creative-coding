## Welcome to Creative Coding

*Post: Week 1*

Dear Creative Coding Students,

Welcome to DXB211. The teaching team and I are excited to meet you and begin work on the semester. Here is some information to get you started.

### Lectures begin this week

* Lecture slides for week 1 are up on Blackboard. You should also review the accompanying notes and videos so we can discuss them in class.
* The lecture will be on Thursday at 12noon in KG-N515
* Virtual lectures are for people who can't attend the in-person lecture. Even though there is a timetabled virtual lecture session, you can watch the lectures whenever you like during the week.
* Tip: My advice is to attend the physical lecture if you can. People tend to find the content much easier to understand in-person. And you can ask questions easier too.

### Tutorials begin next week

* Tutorials will be on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays starting in week 2.
* Check the Blackboard 'Unit Details' section for a full timetable.
* If you are not registered for a tutorial yet, make sure you register before the end of this week.
* There are no tutorials in week 1  but there is an online activity you can complete: Hello p5js

### Blackboard is now available

* Watch the welcome video.
* Familiarize yourself with the resources on the site.
* Review the lecture notes, assignment 1 task sheet and hello p5js activity.

### Assignment 1 released

* The first assignment is also up on Blackboard.
* Have a look at that and let me or your tutors know in class if you have any questions.

As always, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Jared Donovan
Unit Coordinator & Lecturer,  j.donovan@qut.edu.au

## Weekend watching for Creative Coding

*Post: Week 2*

Dear DXB211 students,

I hope you're all staying dry in this weather! Just to remind you that you can always find the lecture recordings by clicking on the 'tools' link in Blackboard and then clicking through to the lecture recordings. I've also put a link in the resources page for this week's lecture.

Also, please make sure you check out the 'hello processing' introductory online tutorial before next week. It will give you a basic understanding of the Processing environment.

I have also created a discussion forum for week 1, which is linked from the lecture page. If you have any questions or problems, please post them there and we will answer for you!

Kind regards,
Jared Donovan.

## Guest lecture and Assignment 2

*Post: Week 6*

Dear DXB211 students,

I hope you have all had a restful break. Your tutors and I have been working through the marking for your first assignment and are aiming to have the results back to you in time for the tutorials on Tuesday. We are very pleased with the quality of work so far, so well done to you all!

Next week, we begin work on Assignment 2. Please familiarize yourself with the task sheet in the assessment section of Blackboard. Read through the four available briefs and think about which one you would like to choose ahead of the lecture and tutorials next week.

I am also very excited about the lecture next week. We will have a guest lecture from Thom Saunders, director of Zone4 Digital Media. 

[http://www.zone4.com.au/](http://www.zone4.com.au/)

I strongly encourage you to come to the lecture in person if you can. Thom has a huge wealth of experience in digital media, visualization, user experience, interactive entertainment, and visual design. He will be specifically discuss the Assignment 2 briefs with you and talk about how he would approach them from an industry perspective.

You will also get a chance to ask Thom questions about industry practice, what employers and clients are looking for in graduates, and anything else you can think of!

You should definitely take advantage of this opportunity to connect with a local industry leader.

I look forward to seeing you all next week.

Kind regards,
Jared Donovan.

## Assignment 1 results released

*Post: Week 8*

Dear DXB211 students,

Assignment 1 results are now released and should be available on Blackboard. Please let me know if there are any problems.

Also - a reminder that there are no tutorials and no lecture this this week due to the pubic holiday on Friday. However, I have created a video demonstration that you should watch to explain how to create a simple object:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCd6TPclLMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCd6TPclLMU)

Please also check out the Processing tutorial on Objects ahead of next week's tutorial:

* [https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/](https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/)

Finally - remember that if you are planning to take the design your own brief option,  you need to send your written briefs to me by this friday for approval.

Kind regards,
Jared Donovan.

## Reminder DYOB briefs due today

*Post: Week 9*

Dear DXB211 students,

A reminder that if you are planning on taking on the 'Design Your Own Brief', you need to send that through to me this week for approval (j.donovan@qut.edu.au). So far, I have only received (and approved) one DYOB :).

Also - I've been keeping an eye on viewing figures for the recorded lectures. There is always a bit of a fall off at this time of the year as people start to get busier with other assessments. That's totally understandable - but please do keep watching even in the final lectures of the semester. There are a lot of really important concepts you will need to know for your second assignment that we cover in these lectures!

Also - remember that this week, I made a special extra online demonstration video that you can watch here:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCd6TPclLMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCd6TPclLMU)

(gripping weekend viewing!)

Have a great weekend and look forward to seeing you all again in tutorials next week.

Kind regards,
Jared Donovan.

## Preparing for Feedback Session next week

Posted on: Thursday, 3 May 2018 9:54:35 AM AEST

Dear DXB211 students,

We almost at the half way mark for assignment 2.

Next week we have an interactive feedback session in the tutorials where you can get feedback on your assignment from your peers and tutors. I have posted a guide on how you should prepare for this along with a description of how we are going to run the activity on Blackboard in the assessment folder for A2:

* [Check out all the info here](./)
  
Look forward to seeing you all next week and learning more about your concepts!

Kind regards,
Jared Donovan.

### Remember to prepare for feedback this week

Posted on: Tuesday, 8 May 2018 2:50:41 PM AEST

Dear DXB211 students,

Please remember to prepare for the feedback session this week and come to tutorials ready to show your work.

See the guide to the feedback session in the assessment 2 folder for details on how it will run and what you need to do.

Also, there have been some questions on whether it is OK to base the brief on an existing movie, album, etc. Yes this is OK. We will just treat it as a reissue :).

See you in tutorials!

Jared Donovan.

## Live Code Demos now on Blackboard

Posted on: Wednesday, 9 May 2018 12:34:12 PM AEST

Dear DXB211 students,

I have created a couple more live coding video demonstrations for your this week. The first one shows how to use a background image as a simple way to control where an on-screen character can move. The second demonstrates collision detection, to tell when one character has hit another. 

You can find them on Blackboard in the 'code demos' folder inside learning resources:

[https://blackboard.qut.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_7363295_1&course_id=_137441_1&mode=cpview](https://blackboard.qut.edu.au/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_7363295_1&course_id=_137441_1&mode=cpview)

I'll do my best to keep uploading one or two of these each week from now until the end of the semester (depending on my schedule). Happy to take requests if there's a particular topic you'd like me to cover. Email: j.donovan@qut.edu.au.

Happy coding!
Jared.

## Creative Coding demo videos this week

Posted on: Friday, 18 May 2018 6:31:11 PM AEST

Dear DXB211 students,

I hope you are looking forward to your weekend. Just to let you know, there are several new coding demo videos from this week that you may find useful:

* **Scrolling background:** A series of 4 videos that show different ways to implement a scrolling background, including with a parallax effect.
* **GUI Videos:** Two videos looking at some ways you can use graphical user interface (GUI) elements to your sketches.
  
I hope some of you find those useful for your assignments. Let me know if you have requests for any other topics you would like me to cover. I'm really enjoying making these videos, so happy to do some more :).

Also - remember, there are no lectures next week or the week after, but there are tutorials.

See you there!

Kind regards,
Jared Donovan.

## Creative Coding week 13

Posted on: Monday, 28 May 2018 9:25:53 AM AEST

Dear DXB211 students,

Congratulations, you have made it to week 13. You have one last push to complete so you can submit your final assignment on Friday. Make sure you check the assignment submission requirements in the 'Assessment' section of Blackboard. The assignment brief has detailed information on what is required for the pitch document. Multiple submissions are allowed, so submit early and often. Assignments submitted late without an approved extension will not be marked.

This week's tutorial sessions will be fully devoted to helping you with your final assignment. Please be prepared with all the resources you need to show your submission, including running code and showing documentation. Your tutor's time will be limited this week. The last tutorial is usually the busiest of the semester for us!

You should have made a start on your assignment by now and at least have a working first version of your sketch. If you have not yet started, you should devote several hours between now and your tutorial to getting a first version working. Your tutor will only be able to provide limited support / advice if you have not started.

We also recommend that when you come to the tutorial, be prepared to use the time to work on your assignment. Don't just wait for the tutor to see you. Talk to classmates, look up online resources and use your own debugging to solve problems too!

Finally, please note that the Insight survey is currently open. We greatly appreciate the feedback you provide on this so that we can know where we are doing well and where we need to continue to improve the unit.

We have also made a separate survey specifically for DXB211, which gives some specific feedback on the learning resources. It is only 4 questions, so please take a minute or two to fill it out at the following link if you haven't already:

* [https://goo.gl/forms/ZTxDMMSfxQh6KfbK2](https://goo.gl/forms/ZTxDMMSfxQh6KfbK2)

We are really looking forward to seeing your assignment 2 submissions.

Kind regards,
Jared Donovan and the DXB211 teaching team.
