<p class="lead">
  Tutorials for the last week of semester will be for assignment 2 support and
  guidance.  Please come prepared for these sessions.  Make sure you bring your
  sketches, and a list of specific questions and issues you want to address.
  Keep in mind that teaching staff can give you guidance on how to solve
  problems, but cannot write your code for you.

Tutorial Notes:

BUT many students will want to use the principles in their assessment.

The focus is on learning how to use PVector to create movement.

You could walk through the online tutorial: http://processing.org/tutorials/pvector/

(But skip over the vector math section as most students will not have the math background.)

This is from Shiffmans’s nature of code  - which you can download on line http://natureofcode.com/ (set your own price - even free) - the book is also in the dropbox folder for 205, in books folder.


Sketches:

1) basicVector

Uses PVector for location, velocity and acceleration

Add some other forces wind etc to see how it might effect it.

turn this sketch into a class and make multiple objects move.

2) motion101_acceleration AND NOC_2_1_forces

Examples use a class - from shiffman’s text above.  Check out the sketches from chapter 1 and 2. The two above are a good start - acceleration, and then force.


Make some Acceleration/Force Algorithms

Make up a constant acceleration - to simulate gravity - then add “wind”
Make an “attractor” - acceleration towards on point on screen
Interactive acceleration - increase / decrease with key input
Interactive attraction or repulsion, acceleration towards or aware from mouse.

To do above you will need to use other PVector functions.


- limit() - to set a max speed.  e.g. terminal velocity of a falling object.

- dist() - between two vectors, considered as points - handy for attraction etc

- normalize() - handy for interactive methods to keep vector within a “normal” scale.

- get() - to make a copy of a PVector. Needed if we want to pass a PVector around, as when we pass an object to a function we pass a reference.  A bit advance but may be cause an issue in some contexts.

3) Challenge.

Make a simple game like simulation using PVector and a class.

)) more advanced - so no need to make from scratch - maybe just show.

4) fishy_boids

uses the boids behavior to create a school of fish.
(does not use vectors)

5) Boids, and other agent examples from the Nature of Code examples (in examples menu in processing)
