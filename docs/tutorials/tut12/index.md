  In this weeks tutorial, we will work on your assignment 2 concepts. Don't
  spend your whole tutorial waiting for the tutor to come to you. Instead, we
  suggest you have a mini feedback session by talking to the person next to
  you about where you are up to and any problems you may be having.

### Advanced Topics

Several students have requested support in understanding collision detection.
If you are interested in this, you may find the following p5js example useful.
Also check the coding demo video on this topic on Blackboard:

<ul class="code-list">

  {% include example_card.html name="Circle collision" thumb="images/circle-collision-thumb.png" link="https://editor.p5js.org/awarua/sketches/CqQMnGzcb" caption="Demonstrates a simple physics simulation that takes into account the mass of the objects." %}

</ul>

Also - for a more advanced introduction to a more full featured physics library 
that you can use in p5js, check out the following chapter from the Nature of
Code book:

* [Chapter 5: Physics Libraries](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-5-physics-libraries/)

Although the book is written for Processing (the Java version of p5js), you can
find p5js versions of all the examples at the following page:

* [p5js versions of NOC Examples](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js/tree/master/chp05_libraries/box2d-html5)

The following page which explains 'state machines' may be useful for students planning a game-like submission for assignment 2. Again, this is not in p5js, 
but the concepts should be understandable and applicable by you:

* [State](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html)

If you have any other ideas for topics you would like to be covered in a coding
demo, email [j.donovan@qut.edu.au](mailto:j.donovan@qut.edu.au) with your
suggestions!

## Survey on DXB303

The following survey is to gather information from you that we can use to improve DXB303 in future. Please take 5 minutes to answer the 4 questions in the survey. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
