<p class="lead">
  In this weeks tutorial, we will work on your assignment 2 concepts. Don't spend your whole tutorial waiting for the tutor to
  come to you. Instead, we suggest you have a mini feedback sesson
  by talking to the person next to you about where you are up to and
  any problems you may be having.

### Advanced Topics

Several students have requested support in understanding collision detection. If you are interested in this, you may find the following processing example useful. Also check the coding demo video on this topic on Blackboard:

* [Circle Collision](https://processing.org/examples/circlecollision.html)

Also - for a more advanced introduction to a more full featured physics library that you can use in Processing, check out the following chapter from the Nature of Code book:

* [Chapter 5: Physics Libraries](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-5-physics-libraries/)

The following page which explains 'state machines' may be useful for students planning a game-like submission for assignment 2:

* [State](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html)

If you have any other ideas for topics you would like to be covered in a coding demo, email [j.donovan@qut.edu.au](mailto:j.donovan@qut.edu.au) with your request.

## Survey on DXB303

The following survey is to gather information from you that we can use to improve DXB303 in future. Please take 5 minutes to answer the 4 questions in the survey. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
