WHAT'S worse than a debilitating fear of flying?
Well a British boy trapped overseas by a sudden flying phobia claims he's now terrified of ALL types of transportation.
Joe Thompson, 11, had hoped to return home by a two-week land, sea or train trip but remains stranded in the UAE desert with his father after his condition worsened.
His father Tony has been forced to find a job in the Gulf while his worried mother waits at home in Somerset, UK, visiting the pair on holidays.
Joe made headlines after developing a sudden and irrational fear of flying more than seven weeks ago.
The latest setback came at the weekend after Joe and his father tried leaving Al Ain in the UAE via hire car in an attempt to reach Jordan and then catch a ferry to Haifa, Israel.
Joe suffered massive panic attacks and hyperventilated in the driveway, with his symptoms even worse than his previous four failed attempts to board a plane in recent weeks.
His condition has baffled doctors.
Joe earlier told US broadcaster CNN his body kept going into lockdown at the airport, despite him being happy to return home.
"I kept on crying. I sat down. I couldn't move. I just couldn't do it, he said.
He has even tried sedation and hypnotherapy, but still hasn't been able to remain onboard the aircraft, and on one occasion even leapt over seats to get out of the plane.
