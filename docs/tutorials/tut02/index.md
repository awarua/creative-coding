<p class="lead">
  This is the first week of tutorials. Please make sure sign up to a
  tutorial class and that you attend the first tutorial. In this
  weeks' tutorial we'll make our first sketch in Processing. You'll learn
  how to draw images using code, and introduce foundational programming
  concepts of variables, functions and decision making. The sketch will use
  basic shapes, lines and color combined with Mouse Input to create a drawing program. The outcomes of the in class activity will form part of
  the assignment 1 submission.

### Advanced

If this tutorial is easy and you want a challenge then try using Bezier curves
for drawing smooth lines.

## Active drawing examples

The two processing sketches linked to below are examples of the kind of thing 
you might aim for in the 'Active Drawing' activity.
