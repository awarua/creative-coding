<p class="lead">
  In this week's tutorial we'll look at using Processing to create Patterns
  exploring foundational programming concept of iteration (looping and repeating).
  We'll add mouse and time as inputs to the sketch to vary the results. We'll
  also look at random and noise functions. The outcomes of the in class activity
  will form of the assignment 1 submission. The outcome should be a sketch
  which makes a visual pattern using a for loop, and where keyboard input varies
  the pattern.
