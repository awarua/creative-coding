<p class="lead">
  In this week's tutorial, we will run an interactive feedback session where you
  will have the opportunity to present your work so far on your second
  assignment and get feedback from your tutor and peers.
</p>

## What you should prepare

For the feedback session, you should be ready to show whatever you currently
have for your second assignment. Set your files up on a computer in the
tutorial so you can show them to other people.

Suggestions for what to include:

* A brief description of your concept. 50 words or less. Write it out.
* Who your target audience is, and how the concept relates to them.
* Screenshots of any early experiments you've made and progress so far.
* Pictures and links to similar examples and creative influences.

<p class="info">
  <strong>Make sure you put something up:</strong> Don't worry if you haven't
  got a finished version of everything. Even if you have only <em>just</em>
  started on your assignment, it will be useful to get feedback on your
  direction.

## Set up for feedback session

For the feedback session, everyone should set up their work on their computers
so it's ready to demo. The the class will split into two. Half the class will
take the role fo pitching their concepts. The other class will take the role of
clients who are trying to understand the concepts and give feedback on the
direction. Clients will then wander around the class and visit all of the
different pitches.

After 20 minutes you will swap roles. Pitchers will take the role of clients and
clients will take the role of pitchers. Take another 20 minutes to
visit the pitches and give feedback.

At the end, we will have a class discussion to compare notes and point to any
particularly good concepts. We will also go through the marking sheet and
highlight any areas that people need to pay more attention to.

### Role of pitchers

The role of the pitchers is to explain your concept clearly and briefly. You are
not trying to 'sell' your concept at this stage. You are trying to get feedback
that can help check if you are on the right track:

* **Explain:** By trying to explain your concept to other people you will also
  understand it better yourself.
* **Enquire:** Don't just present your concept. Also ask questions of your
  audience. Try to find out if there are aspects they don't understand.
* **Compare:** Look for common points of confusion or misunderstanding â€“ these
  probably point to aspects of the concept that are underdeveloped.
* **Record:** Take notes. Don't rely on your memory. Take notes about the feedback
  people give you so you can use it later.

### Role of clients

The role of the clients is to carefully listen to the pitches and give
constructive feedback. Your role is not to 'accept' or 'decline' the pitch, but
to check that the direction of development and help the designers strengthen
their concepts:

* **Listen:** By listening to pitches, you also should get a sense of how your
  own concepts compares and how it could improve.
* **Ask:** Don't just listen and give vague encouragement. Ask probing
  questions. If there are aspects of the concept that don't make sense, seek
  clarification.
* **Probe:** Look for common weaknesses across the pitches. Are there areas
  where the class as a whole needs to give more attention?
* **Check:** Check against the marking sheet. Look for areas that might need
  additional work in the rest of the assignment.

### Summarize results

As a whole, the class should discuss what was found. Add any common observations
or questions to the following [GoSoapBox page](https://app.gosoapbox.com) and we
will address them in next week's lecture.

Use access code **dxb303-tut10** to join the poll.

### Planning ahead

We now at the half way mark of the assignment. Remember that the final weeks of
the semester can often be very busy. You are not expected to have a completed
submission by now, but you should at least have made a start and ideally have a
good idea of your concept.

Today's session should have given you some actionable feedback that you can use
to help you complete the assignment. Spend some time thinking about how you are
going to use the remaining time and focus on the areas that are the most
important for your submission.
