### What is p5js?

P5js is a javascript library for creative coding.

### Watch the Hello p5js video

This short [interactive video](http://hello.p5js.org/) gives an introduction to
the p5 project from Lauren McCarthy and Dan Shiffman. Notice how the graphics in
the video are interactive? That's all done with the p5 library. Make sure you
click around and explore how things work!
