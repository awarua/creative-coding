## Tutor Guide wk09

[tutorial](./index.html)

This is a bit of an in-between tutorial. Because the Friday tutorials are 
one-week out of sync, it is introduced to Monday..Thursday tutorials before
 the due date for assignment 1, but it actually doesn’t count towards that 
 assignment.  

The intention is that this could provide some good techniques for students 
to use in their assignment 2. In this second assignment, they will need to 
get a bit beyond just hacking and bashing things together. They will need 
some better tools for structuring their code, so objects are one good way 
for them to do that. 

Using objects is not required for Assignment 2, BUT many students will find
this is the best way to realise their ideas for that assignment.

### Suggested outline

1) Walk through making the aquarium example. Have students follow along so 
they have a working example on their computers.

2) Once done with that, get students to work in pairs and give them the 
challenge to add another kind of creature to the aquarium (e.g. snail, 
starfish, submarine) 
  - They should work in pairs to implement that as an object, 
  - including thinking about how it should be drawn to the canvas
  - how it should move, 
  - and how it can be added to the aquarium through user input.


This could take quite a while, so don’t let the students continue too long.
I’d suggest pausing with at least 40 minutes remaining in the tutorial so 
you can address other questions (e.g. about assignments). But before going
on to general questions and work, pick out one or two good examples and 
show them to the rest of the class.

3) For the remainder of the tutorial students may want to work on their 
assignments, so you can use the time to help them with that. 

If any want to continue with the aquarium example, there’s lots they could 
do there - e.g:
  - add ways to vary movement or drawing of the fish to make quorum more diverse 
  - add tail and fins by drawing triangles
  - use bitmaps instead of drawing triangle. Best with pngs that have an alpha 
    channel.
  - add fish sounds
  - add a second Class for a different type of object - asteroids, insects etc etc.
  - give the aquarium inhabitants ‘thought bubbles’ with text captions.
