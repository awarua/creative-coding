## Introduction

* Introduction to this course
  * Assumed knowledge
  * What creative coding is
  * Why creative coding matters
* Introduction to the P5js editor
  * Editor set-up
  * Online editor
* First p5js sketch - (World's simplest drawing program)
  * Structure of a p5.js sketch
    * Anatomy of a sketch
      * setup
      * draw
      * comment at the top
      * global variables
    * Other files (index.html, style.css, library files)
  * Basic drawing functions
    * point, line, circle, ellipse, square, rect
    * built-in variables (width, height)
  * Appearance functions
    * fill()
    * stroke()
    * strokeWeight()
    * color()
    * Understand that these are globally set
  * Understanding functions (we won't define our own function yet)
    * Arguments
    * Order of execution
    * Return values
  * Responding to the mouse
    * mouseX, mouseY
  * if statement
    * if (mouseIsPressed){}
    * Only show the circle when the mouse is pressed
  * Random function
    * Setting a random size
    * Setting a random x, y offset (spray-paint)
  * Don't clear the background
  * event handling function
    * mousePressed
      * Use this to set a new random colour. You wouldn't want to do this using
        the mouseIsPressed variable because it would constantly change.

  student in the tutorial so this one probably isn't relevant) - Posted by Jordy
* draggable images and changing canvases (if this feature is possible --> i.e.
