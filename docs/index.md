        <b>Hello p5js</b>
        Note: There are no in-person tutorials in week 1. This is an online activity
        to familiarize yourself with p5js. The aim of this tutorial is to get you 
        familiar with the p5js library. You will also write your first programming
        'sketch' with p5js.

        <b>Active Drawing</b>
        This is the first week of in-person tutorials. Please make sure sign up to a tutorial class and that you attend the first tutorial. In this weeks' tutorial we'll make our first sketch in Processing. You'll learn how to draw images using code, and introduce foundational programming concepts of variables, functions and decision making. The sketch will use basic shapes, lines and color combined with Mouse Input to create a drawing program. The outcomes of the in class activity will form part of the assignment 1 submission.

        In this week's tutorial we'll look at using p5js to create Patterns exploring foundational programming concept of iteration (looping and repeating). We'll add mouse and time as inputs to the sketch to vary the results. We'll also look at random and noise functions. The outcomes of the in class activity will form of the assignment 1 submission. The outcome should be a sketch which makes a visual pattern using a for loop, and where keyboard input varies the pattern.

This is the last in-class activity that'll form part of the assignment 1 submission. The sketch for this part of the assignment must involve drawing some text to the screen and it must change over time, without user input. You will learn some ways to do this in this tutorial.

        will go through the assignment brief with you to make sure you understand it.
        You will start by brainstorming ideas for the assignment and sketching these
        on paper. Your tutor will discuss with you how you could go about implementing
        the concepts and highlight the programming concepts that you will need to
        apply. This tutorial will also introduce the translation functions, and show
        you how to work with shapes and curves. This will allow you to create more
        complex visual output from your sketches.

        As your sketches become more complex, you will find that

        learn how to define 'classes' in your code that describe the different parts
        of your sketch. This is the concept of Object Oriented programming. You will
        work through an example in class in which you create some of your own objects
        and employ them in a simple interactive sketch.
